**ðŸŽ¯ Hit your mark. Achieve success!**

A web application created by Leah Livingston

### **Project Idea and Description**
Ever dream of achieving your personal goals with the same precision and focus as the Fortune 100 companies? Look no further. This project brings the power of OKRs to your fingertips. 

###### What's an OKR?
OKR, short for [objectives and key results](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/what-is-an-okr-definition-examples/), is a proven goal-setting tool that holds accountability, tracks progress, and helps to achieve milestones that might seem "just out of reach". Imagine setting a [BHAG goal](https://asana.com/resources/bhag-big-hairy-audacious-goal), aligning it with your deepest desire, and having a clear roadmap to success!


###### Why do I need this?
* **Accountability**: Stay on course, achieve your dreams, and watch your progress
* **Focus**: Laser-focus on what truly matters to you (and future you)
* **Motivation**: Experience the thrill of accomplishment as you move closer to your dreams, one milestone at a time.


###### Is this right for me?
* Are you longing to buy a house but struggle to save that initial deposit?
* Do you dream of a healthier lifestyle but find yourself ordering takeout more often than hitting the gym?
* Have you always wanted to write a book but can't find time in your hectic schedule?

*You're not alone!* 

Life happens, and that's why OKRs are the secret weapon that you should be using.
