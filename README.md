### **Project Idea and Description**
Do you dream of achieving personal [BHAG goals](https://asana.com/resources/bhag-big-hairy-audacious-goal), but get overwhelmed thinking about how to get there?

*You're not alone.* 

This project was created to help individuals adopt the same precision and focus as Fortune 100 companies. Set challenging objectives with measurable key results. Align these with a long-term strategy to create your personal roadmap to success. Bring the power of OKRs to your life, and empower your future.


###### What's an OKR?
Short for [objectives and key results](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/what-is-an-okr-definition-examples/), OKRs are a proven goal-setting tool that holds you accountable, tracks your progress, and helps you achieve milestones that might seem "just out of reach". 

###### How does it work?
* **Accountability** - Write it down, regularly check-in, and grade your results to pivot when necessary 
* **Laser Focus** - Hone in on what truly matters to you (and future you)
* **Motivation** - Experience the thrill of accomplishment, one milestone at a time

OKRs are the secret weapon consulting firms deploy at large organizations. Do the same with your life.

**ðŸŽ¯ Hit your mark. Achieve success!**
